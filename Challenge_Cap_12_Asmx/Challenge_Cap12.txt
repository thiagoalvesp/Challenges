Challenge 1: Create ASMX Web Service
Create a database of School with one table, Student having required fields (StudentID as primary key and
StudentName). Create a Web Service named SchoolService and include ADO.NET for databse interactivity.
The service should include two methods to add and read all students (students should be returned to client
in JSON format). Create a console project (Client) which exposes this service and consumes the written
methods in service.
[Hint] Create an Asp.NET Empty Web Project with the name SchoolService and then add an ASMX
web service named SchoolWebService. Write the Add() method for add student and the ReadAll() method
for read all students. Add an ADO.NET component into this project to connect the service with a database.
Make another class (Serializable) so that data can be sent in serialized form. Without making data
serializable, it does not send back to the client.
