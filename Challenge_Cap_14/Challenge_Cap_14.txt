Challenge 1: Install a .DLL to Global Assembly Cache
It’s not a code challenge, but rather a practice session in which you have to 
create a .dll file and install it to a Global Assembly Cache.
The solution is available in this chapter but don't look at it until you forget steps
for installing an assembly to a GAC.

1 - Enter path of project
2 - VS prompt(with adm privileges) sn -k myClassLibrarykey.snk
3 -  AssemblyInfo.cs put [assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("myClassLibrarykey.snk")]
4 - gacutil -i "{file path of strong name assembly}.dll"
