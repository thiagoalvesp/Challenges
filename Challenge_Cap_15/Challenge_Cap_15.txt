Challenge 1: Perform tracing and logging in your application.
Build an application of dividing two numbers. The divisor must be zero. Trace the code and log into
EventLog in an appropriate manner so that you can find out what, where, and which kind of data is traced
and logged.
Challenge 2: Implement Performance Counter in your application.
Make a console application, which should have 2 choices for the user: 1- Input, 2-Output. When the user
types 1 and presses enter, it should take the input (single input of any type) and count as 100 and so on.
When the user types 2 and presses enter, it should display the number of inputs the user has entered so far.
Implement Performance Counter to keep track of user inputs. Handle the code if the user mistakenly enters
any other type of input
